## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Reproduce the Issue

First, try to reproduce the issue consistently. Note down any specific steps or conditions that trigger the problem.

### Step 2: Check Logs

Inspect any error messages or warnings in the logs. Logs are typically located at [path/to/logs]. Look for stack traces or error codes that provide clues about the issue.

### Step 3: Review Code Changes

If the issue started after recent code changes, review those changes. Use version control tools like Git to view commit history and changes made to relevant files.

```
git log
git diff [commit_hash]
```

```
git diff [commit_hash]

```
